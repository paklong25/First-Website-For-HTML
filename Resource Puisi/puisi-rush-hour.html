    <h1>Title: "Two Worlds, One Goal"</h1>

        <p>In the bustling city alleys,<br />
        Two souls meet in one movement,<br />
        One from the east, full of tranquility,<br />
        One from the west, jokes without limits.</p>
        
        <p>The agile Lee, moves like the wind,<br />
        Silently present without a cold sound,<br />
        The loud Carter, brings cheerful laughter,<br />
        His tongue is sharp, always brave to be clear.</p>
        
        <p>They are different, the world is not the same,<br />
        But the enemy in front of them remains the same,<br />
        In pursuit, in laughter and running,<br />
        They are united, never stopping.</p>
        
        <p>Footsteps dancing in the fight,<br />
        Laughter in the gap, destroying disaster,<br />
        Among the bullets, behind the secret,<br />
        They win, with extraordinary style.</p>
        
        <p>Two worlds, one definite goal,<br />
        Guarding what is right, defending without stopping,<br />
        In Rush Hour, they conquer the world,<br />
        In action and laughter, forever making a sound.</p>
