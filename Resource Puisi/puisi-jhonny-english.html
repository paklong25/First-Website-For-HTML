    <h1>Title: "Flawless Agent, Failed Without Hesitation"</h1>

        <p>Behind a neat suit and a twisted tie,<br />
        An agent stands, without a bit of fear,<br />
        Johnny English, a name that is spoken proudly,<br />
        Although in every mission, failure greets.</p>
        
        <p>His steps are firm, full of confidence,<br />
        But often, the direction is not in line,<br />
        The sophisticated gadget in his hand is not always right,<br />
        But somehow, he always survives.</p>
        
        <p>The world is in danger, the enemy is waiting,<br />
        But Johnny comes, with an innocent style,<br />
        Destiny laughs at his actions,<br />
        Because success comes through a series of mistakes.</p>
        
        <p>A big explosion, then falls without a plan,<br />
        He rises again, as if it were all just a play,<br />
        With a sly smile and a burning spirit,<br />
        He never gives up, even though he is chased by disaster.</p>
        
        <p>There is nothing more awkward than his movements,<br />
        But in the midst of mistakes, he achieves victory,<br />
        Johnny English, an unpredictable agent,<br />
        In his silliness, the world is still safe too.</p>
        
        <p>Behind the jokes and blunders that decorate,<br />
        Hidden is an intention that is always firm,<br />
        Because even though it is not perfect, it still survives,<br />
        The agent is invincible, with laughter as a friend.</p>
