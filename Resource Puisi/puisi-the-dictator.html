<h1>Title: "Laughter Behind the Throne"</h1>

<p>On a barren land, stands the king,<br />
A golden crown, his power is like steel,<br />
But behind the hard, endless gaze,<br />
Hidden is a joke that brings the world into a bind.</p>

<p>He speaks, the world bows in lies,<br />
His rules are strange, full of will alone,<br />
With a thick mustache and a brilliant military uniform,<br />
He makes laws, as if this life is just lost.</p>

<p>Laughter echoes, but not from freedom,<br />
The people are silent, under the shadow of fear,<br />
But the dictator, with his cruel face,<br />
Disarms reality with his satirical comedy.</p>

<p>He is the ruler, but not everyone believes,<br />
Behind the violence, there is an absurdity that exists,<br />
The world laughs, although full of irony,<br />
Because in his hands, stupidity becomes art.</p>

<p>In a parody of power, he dances alone,<br />
Turning reality upside down, as if he doesn't care,<br />
In "The Dictator," he is both king and clown,<br />
In one laugh, the world is entangled.</p>

<p>Laughter and power, mixed together, In a dark joke, tyranny is shackled, Behind his crown, he is just a man, Who leads in the shadows, with laughter as a weapon.</p>
